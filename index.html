                    J.R.R Tolkien, the man dubbed 'Father of Fantasy', influenced the world in many ways through his life and works. He was a noted philologist and professor, in addition to being the author of beloved fantasy works including The Lord of the Rings and The
                    Hobbit. Perhaps one of the most remarkable aspects of his creative work is its intense attention to detail. He created languages, detailed maps, and genealogical tables for his characters, seeding the ground for a rich fan base that
                    has thrived over nearly a century. His work continues to inspire games, movies, and writing in the genre of high fantasy.

                                        and wrote: "For anyone who likes the genre to which it belongs, the Heroic Quest, I cannot imagine a more wonderful Christmas present... No fiction I have read in the last five years has given me more joy than The
                                        Fellowship of the Ring."</p>
                                    <p>Fellow Inkling CS Lewis also gave it a rave review. "If Ariosto rivalled it in invention (in fact he did not) he would still lack its heroic seriousness. No imaginary world has been projected which is at once multifarious
                                        and so true to its own inner laws; none so seemingly objective, so disinfected from the taint of an author's merely individual psychology; none so relevant to the actual human situation yet free from allegory. And
                                        what fine shading there is in the variations of style to meet the endless diversity of scenes and characters - comic, homely, epic, monstrous, or diabolic."</p>
